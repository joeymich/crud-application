# crud-application
Crud application created using the tkinter gui module. Data is stored in json files so that info is saved between sessions. The gui is modeled after a sneaker bot.

## Installation
To Install Files:
```
git clone https://github.com/joeymich/crud-application
```

## Usage
```
python main.py
```
After successfuly running main.py, make sure to add at least one profile before attempting ot make any tasks. Currently, the program allows for 1,000 instances of each task, profile, and proxy, but this can be easily changed by adjusting the `fetch_id` method.
